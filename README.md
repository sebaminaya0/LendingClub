## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using lendingclub.com data from 2007-2010 to better understand:

- ¿How long it takes for users to pay back their loans?
- ¿Which are the purposes that tend to be more profitable?
- ¿Can we predict which loans will be fully paid?

This dataset ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data)) consists of data from almost 10,000 borrowers that took loans - with some paid back and others still in progress. It was extracted from lendingclub.com which is an organization that connects borrowers with investors.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions of Step 1. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sebastian.minaya1998/this-is-why-having-a-working-framework-will-make-you-a-better-data-professional-c0e60e1d3a38).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to lendingclub.com for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
